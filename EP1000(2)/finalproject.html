  <p>Project title: Moon lamp
  </p>

  <p>A Miniature globes emit a soft, soothing light. On the other hand, it mimic the actual texture of the surface of the moon and brightens up the room . Especially to those people that are afraid of the dark. Dont be scared the moon lamp will accompany you in the darkness.

  What are it's features? Light can change a mood from nervous and rushed to quiet and peaceful</p>

   <h3> Sketch of the design</h3> 
 <img src="C:\Users\serih\OneDrive\Desktop\EP1000(2)\images\sketch1.jpg" alt="myself" class="jwtemplate" width="500" height="450">

    <p> A Sketch of what i was planning to create. The moon was actually supposed to bigger by 270mm. However it may take a while to be printed out. So I decided to reduce the diameter to 70mm, it is very small yet it can still light up .</p>  

    <p> For the moon, i did 3D print and the infill is white in color. It takes approximately 1 hour to complete the process.

 <img src="C:\Users\serih\OneDrive\Desktop\EP1000(2)\images\box.jpg" alt="myself" class="jwtemplate" width="800" height="450">
   <p> A box design 150mm X 130mm was done in fusion 360. The hole is a diameter of 70mm exactly the same as the moon diameter. That is to ensure the moon is intact</p>

 <br>
 <img src="C:\Users\serih\OneDrive\Desktop\EP1000(2)\images\lasercut.jpg" alt="myself" class="jwtemplate" width="500" height="450">

    <p> Once i am done with the designing on Fusion 360, I will download the fiels to the computer with my USB. Afterwards, I will set it to hairline which is in red. This is to indicate the the lines that will be laser cut. Press print and it will lead to corel draw.Lastly, set the power accordin to the plywood requirements. 
    </p>

    <p> The challenges i faced is that during that time, 3mm plywood wasn't available in the workshop. I have to go to T11 to take the ply wood myself as it takes up my time to do it . On the other hand, there are multiple times that other students are using currently & there isn't much time for me to print it out</p>

    <p> The challenges for the moon will be the deisgn did not go according to what i have done in fusion 360. There are some few defects at the bottom of the moon.
    </p> 
     
    <p> For the circuits, i was supposed to use nano instead of the arduino. This is because i shorcircuited my nano when i was currently doing some wiring. I did it like up to 4-5 times. From this i learned that i have to be very specific when doing circuits and very clear as to  compelte the LED lightings.</p>

    <p>This is the circuit that I have completed for my moon lamp design.

   <div>

 <img src="C:\Users\serih\OneDrive\Desktop\EP1000(2)\images\nano.jpg" alt="myself" class="jwtemplate" width="500" height="450"> 

    <p> This is the circuit that i am tryign to tranfer to nano. I did once in class but only one oft he LED light up eventho i was using the code and i did triple checked. When I got home, I tried with the nano for up to 3 times and suddenly the nano just doesn't work anymore or light up</p>

    <p>The challenges I faced is when it is really hard to see the connection in the nano as it is a veyr small version. Nonetheless, i did managed to connect it just that it doesn't light up. From this experience, I will like to practice more. This might be the first project i have ever made but it is worth it as I get to learn new things.</p>
